# Curly Parser Combinator
A parser combinator implemented in C. Mainly made as an exercise, but you're welcome to use it if you'd like.

## Why curly?
It's actually pronounced COMB-inator, not comBINator. Doofenshmirtz tried to use it to take over the tristate area by giving everyone disgustingly straight hair.
